## User Manual of me

Iska waran <img src="https://github.com/TheDudeThatCode/TheDudeThatCode/blob/master/Assets/Hi.gif" width="29px"> I’m Abshir (**AB-SH-EAR**) born in the **White Pearl of the Indian Ocean** (Mogadishu, Somalia) but have been living in **Camden** since fleeing civil war in my country aged 2.

### Conditions I like to work in
I love working in **fun vibrant** environments where people can **genuinely be themselves**. I cherish **honesty** and **respect**, which others can expect from me. I love **banter** and I tend to goof around quite a lot 🤪 

I enjoy working in **collaborative** environments yet I enjoy me some **autonomy**. I like working in environments where **team** and **individual contributions** are **noticed**, **recognised** and **rewarded**. I try to praise and bring the best out of those around me often.

I have a strong appetite for **learning** and **understanding** new things, so you’ll find I ask a lot of questions. I am technically minded and love a good **challenge**, and I get a good kick out of **solving problems**.

Finally, I learn best through **audio/visual** mediums, I love me a good **block diagram**. I read **documentations** for clarity and I like to get stuck right in. 

### The times/hours I like to work
I work well throughout the day, however, if I’ve had a large lunch 🍔 it usually takes some time for me to get back into gear ⚙️ 

### The best ways to communicate with me
I prefer **face to face** communication where possible. 
You can **slack** me a message anytime, I tend to respond pretty quickly. 
You can also **email** me but I tend not to check my emails as often.

I’m not a mind reader so if I've offended you unknowingly or you feel a certain way, **please let me know** and I will certainly stop whatever behaviour it is that makes you feel upset. **It’s not healthy to hold grudges**.

### The ways I like to receive feedback
A **regular** dose of **feedback** is what I need. I need to know when I’m doing something well and when I’m not. Coupled with an example of the situation/scenario. I’m a big boy, so be brutally honest with feedback. How can I improve if I don’t know where I need to improve?

### Things I need
I need **clear time-boxed goals** and **objectives** to stay motivated. Tasks need to make sense in my head before I get cracking.

I like to work with and pick the brains of all the **passionate**, **smart**, **driven** people around me when working. I also need some space and autonomy from time to time so I can flap my wings.

I sometimes need to let off some steam, I usually do this by going on a walk to clear my mind. Prior to lockdown, I would hit the gym and train on the mat.

### Things I struggle with
I’m a bit of a **perfectionist** and I don’t always take the pragmatic approach when solving problems, this sometimes means delays. I’m still internalising the saying; **_“perfectionism is the enemy of progress”_**.

**Procrastination** is both a friend and an enemy of mine. Although I usually get things done on time, I sometimes leave things till the last minute. For some strange reason I enter **beast mode 🔥** when I’m under time constrained pressure 😫

One thing I cannot stand is **condescending** or **arrogant** tones or behaviours, whether that be directed towards me or towards somebody else. You will **automatically** be placed in my **bad book** if I feel or sense any form of this. I treat people with **respect** and I expect the same. If you have an opportunity to teach me or someone else something, then do it in a respectful non-condescending manner.

### Things I love
I enjoy working with people who take **pride** in their work/trade. Who come with **good energy** and **motivation**. The kind of people who **bring out the best in others** as well as those who have **strong emotional intelligence**.

I enjoy seeing the fruits of my labour, I’m very **results driven**. I love **engineering excellence**.

### Other things to know about me
I am a **family man** with **3 beautiful children** and an **incredible wife**. When I’m not chasing the kids around the house, I’m probably chasing our **stupid cat**. I **love to cook** and am actually pretty good at it. The family loves it when it’s my day to cook.

I’m in a toxic relationship with **Arsenal FC** and I’m actually contemplating revoking my support for them. Surely it’s not good for my health.

I love helping others and thus founded a social enterprise called [Somalis in Tech](https://twitter.com/somalisintech) which aims to **redress the lack of diversity** in the tech space. We host **talks**, **discussions** and **activities**, aimed at **motivating**, **empowering** and **building confidence** within the community.
